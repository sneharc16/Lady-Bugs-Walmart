## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-moving retail world, consumers lack clear, actionable guidance to shop sustainably. Despite rising awareness, they struggle to identify eco-friendly products, track their impact, or feel rewarded. Near-expiry and reusable items often go to waste due to lack of visibility and incentives.
